Methodology: Recursive Partitioning in Isolation Forests
In this project, I treated fraud as a 'materiality' problem. Unlike standard algorithms that define 'normal' behavior, I used recursive partitioning to isolate rare events. Because anomalies are 'few and different,' they are isolated much faster in the tree structure, allowing for high-precision detection in this 284k transaction dataset.
